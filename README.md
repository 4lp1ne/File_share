üì¶ Creating final zip package: transfert_pack.zip
üöÄ Starting HTTP server on port 8080 in new terminal...
‚òÅ Starting localtunnel in new terminal...
‚úÖ Public URL: https://abcde.loca.lt/transfert_pack.zip
üì± Generating QR code...
‚úÖ Transfer ready!
```

---

### üßπ Cleanup

Remove temporary files:

```bash
rm transfert_pack.zip short_url.txt short_url_qr.png
```

---

### üêû Troubleshooting

* **Port already in use**: Try a different port (e.g. `8090`)
* **Missing terminal**: Replace `gnome-terminal` with `konsole`, `xterm`, etc., as needed.
* **Permission errors with npm**: Use `sudo` or [fix npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)
